# Amiga `cd` command replacement

This is free replacement of Amiga OS' `cd` command. It's still incomplete, but does the job where needed.
Feel free to use it in your startup sequences.

This tool has been written without disassembling of the original and let's keep it that way.

**If you've disassembled the original executable or took a peek at original's source code in any way - don't commit any code!**
  Instead, write a short specification for new, legally clean code in an issue.
